# underwater-image-enhancement
## Abstract
Underwater images find application in various fields, like marine research, inspection of
aquatic habitat, underwater surveillance, identification of minerals, and more. However,
underwater shots are affected a lot during the acquisition process due to the absorption
and scattering of light. As depth increases, longer wavelengths get absorbed by water;
therefore, the images appear predominantly bluish-green, and red gets absorbed due to
higher wavelength. These phenomenons result in significant degradation of images due to
which images have low contrast, color distortion, and low visibility. Hence, underwater
images need enhancement to improve the quality of images to be used for various
applications while preserving the valuable information contained in them.
